#+TITLE: todo notes

* DONE Split Makefile into 2 parts (if possible): common and unit-test-specific

  Use ~include~ directive for reading another Makefile

  #+BEGIN_SRC Makefile
  include ../global.Makefile
  #+END_SRC

* TODO Testing setup

  - describe setup
  - what to test: tex4ht styles, tex4ht driver, tex4ht postprocessor
  - how to test it each: styles, driver, postprocessor

* TODO Examples needed
  1. to test style
  2. to test driver
  3. to test postprocessor

* DONE Metadata should go into Test summary report?

  test summary report: ./build/summary.log

* TODO line numbers in diff files: <!--l. 50-->
   can we clean it:
   + using tex4ht option?
   + using diff utils?
