% issue: conflict between hyperref and cleveref;
%        Compiling with make4ht, I get errors
%        A workaround is to remove \usepackage{hyperref} which does not seem to affect the html
%        output. However, I wonder why they are conflict under tex4ht and a better solution for that.
% solution:
%         ???
