\chapter{Chapter one}
Here is a para

Here is a second para

\begin{quoting}
one para inside a small block.

another para inside the block.
\end{quoting}

Now for a para after the quote.

And another para after the quote.

\chapter{Chapter two}
Let's try after a chapter break.

That's good, para breaks work now.

But what happened after the quoting environment in the previous chapter?
